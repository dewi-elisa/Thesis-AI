abstract = {We study textual autocomplete---the task of predicting a full sentence from a
partial sentence---as a human-machine communication game. Specifically, we
consider three competing goals for effective communication: use as few tokens
as possible (efficiency), transmit sentences faithfully (accuracy), and be
learnable to humans (interpretability). We propose an unsupervised approach
which tackles all three desiderata by constraining the communication scheme to
keywords extracted from a source sentence for interpretability and optimizing
the efficiency-accuracy tradeoff. Our experiments show that this approach
results in an autocomplete system that is 52% more accurate at a given
efficiency level compared to baselines, is robust to user variations, and saves
time by nearly 50% compared to typing full sentences.},

abstract = {Query auto completion is known to provide poor predictions of the user's query when her input prefix is very short (e.g., one or two characters). In this paper we show that context, such as the user's recent queries, can be used to improve the prediction quality considerably even for such short prefixes. We propose a context-sensitive query auto completion algorithm, NearestCompletion, which outputs the completions of the user's input that are most similar to the context queries. To measure similarity, we represent queries and contexts as high-dimensional term-weighted vectors and resort to cosine similarity. The mapping from queries to vectors is done through a new query expansion technique that we introduce, which expands a query by traversing the query recommendation tree rooted at the query.
In order to evaluate our approach, we performed extensive experimentation over the public AOL query log. We demonstrate that when the recent user's queries are relevant to the current query she is typing, then after typing a single character, NearestCompletion's MRR is 48% higher relative to the MRR of the standard MostPopularCompletion algorithm on average. When the context is irrelevant, however, NearestCompletion's MRR is essentially zero. To mitigate this problem, we propose HybridCompletion, which is a hybrid of NearestCompletion with MostPopularCompletion. HybridCompletion is shown to dominate both NearestCompletion and MostPopularCompletion, achieving a total improvement of 31.5% in MRR relative to MostPopularCompletion on average.},

abstract = {In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end approach for AI-assisted code
completion called Pythia. It generates ranked lists of method and API
recommendations which can be used by software developers at edit time. The
system is currently deployed as part of Intellicode extension in Visual Studio
Code IDE. Pythia exploits state-of-the-art large-scale deep learning models
trained on code contexts extracted from abstract syntax trees. It is designed
to work at a high throughput predicting the best matching code completions on
the order of 100 $ms$.
We describe the architecture of the system, perform comparisons to
frequency-based approach and invocation-based Markov Chain language model, and
discuss challenges serving Pythia models on lightweight client devices.
The offline evaluation results obtained on 2700 Python open source software
GitHub repositories show a top-5 accuracy of 92\%, surpassing the baseline
models by 20\% averaged over classes, for both intra and cross-project
settings.},
